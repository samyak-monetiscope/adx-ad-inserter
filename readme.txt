Revolutionize your website's monetization with advanced ad formats by Monetiscope. 

== Description ==

AdX Ad Inserter is a modern ad management plugin designed for flexibility and performance. It allows publishers to insert ads such as Google AdSense, popup banners, rewarded video, and custom scripts in precise positions across the site.

**Supports:**
- Google AdSense, Ad Manager (DFP)
- Rewarded ads triggered by button/link click
- Popup ads on delay, scroll, or condition
- Custom header/footer scripts
- Global plugin enable switch
- JSON-based reporting

Insert ads where other plugins fail — after content, in headers, near forms, or based on user actions.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/adx-ad-inserter/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Open “AdX Ad Inserter” from the dashboard menu.
4. Fill in ad codes for each slot (Popup, Rewarded, Custom).
5. Enable slots and triggers using the visual UI.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with Google AdSense? =
Yes. You can paste AdSense scripts in the slots. Both auto ads and manual GPT tags are supported.

= How does the rewarded ad trigger work? =
When a user clicks on a button or link matching your trigger keyword (like “Download” or “Watch Now”), the ad is shown before proceeding.

= Can I inject code into the header and footer? =
Yes, use the Custom slot for inserting HTML/JS in `<head>` or before `</body>`.

= Is this plugin fast? =
Yes, ads are loaded asynchronously and plugin UI is modular for performance.
