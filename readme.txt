== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does AdX Ad Inserter insert any internal ads? =  
No. AdX Ad Inserter never inserts internal or third-party ads on its own. The plugin only displays the ad codes that you configure. 100% control remains with you.

= Is AdX Ad Inserter compatible with Google AdX and Ad Manager (DFP)? =  
Yes. You can paste your AdX or Ad Manager ad slot line directly to show ads on your sites, and the plugin handles safe placement and async loading.

= Can I show popup, rewarded, or interstitial (vignette) ads? =  
Yes. Popup ads can be triggered on scroll. Rewarded ads can be triggered when users click a link or button. Interstitial/Vignette ads can be placed via AdX/Ad Manager or custom scripts.

= Does the plugin support Offerwall ads? =  
Yes. You can integrate Offerwall ads by pasting your Offerwall ad slot line from Google Ad Manager.

= Can I insert ads in the header and footer? =  
Yes. The plugin provides dedicated slots to insert header and footer codes (scripts or styles).

= Can I control placement inside post content? =  
Yes. You can insert ads before or after specific paragraphs or images, with precise offsets.

= How does the ads.txt feature work? =  
The plugin includes a built-in ads.txt manager where you can create and edit your `/ads.txt` file directly from WordPress. If your host blocks root file writing, the plugin will display the content for you to copy and upload manually.

= Does this plugin track my visitors? =  
No. The plugin itself does not track visitors or users. It only loads the ad scripts you provide. However, the ad networks you use (AdSense, Ad Manager, Offerwall, etc.) may collect data according to their privacy policies.

= Privacy Policy ‚Äì Plugin Usage Tracking =  
This plugin does not send any usage or tracking data to Monetiscope or third parties. All ads and scripts are user-configured. Any analytics, targeting, or cookies come from your ad networks, not from the plugin.

= How to display a GDPR-compliant cookie message? =  
AdX Ad Inserter does not include a cookie consent popup. We recommend using a GDPR/CCPA cookie consent plugin alongside AdX Ad Inserter. You can configure it to work with your ad network scripts for compliance.

= Does the plugin slow down my site? =  
No. All ad scripts are loaded asynchronously, and the plugin itself is lightweight with no unnecessary bloat.

= Can I enable or disable the plugin globally? =  
Yes. There is a global enable/disable switch that controls whether ads render at all. Each slot also has its own enable/disable toggle.

= Is it free to use? =  
Yes, AdX Ad Inserter is completely free. There are no hidden charges.
